This immersive show required a versatile rig, suitable for a range of conditions including
matinees and wet weather days. Set in an 80s wedding, the show started in the auditorium.
Then it moved to the garden as the lovers enter the woods, and back inside again for the 
performance of "Pyramus & Thisby" by the rude mechanicals.

Working on this show was an amazing experience, and I really enjoyed it.
